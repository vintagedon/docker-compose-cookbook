## üöÄ About

This repository provides Docker Compose files, along with .env files, in a standardized format that serve as a starting point for spinning up common services and applications in a cookbook-style format.

**NOTE:** This collection is meant to be used in a home lab, non-critical development environment, or for exploring technologies. These compose files should never be used in a production environment without modification to fit your security needs.

## üåü Features

- Comprehensive collection of Docker Compose files
- Utilizes .env files for easy configuration
- Focus on self-hosted technologies
- Designed for use in virtualization home labs
- Covers a wide range of IT and development technologies

## üìö Categories
