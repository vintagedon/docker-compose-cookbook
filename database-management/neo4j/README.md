## Prerequisites

- Docker
- Docker Compose
- At least 2GB of free memory

## Quick Start

1. Clone this repository
2. Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and adjust the variables as needed
3. Run `docker-compose up -d`
4. Access Neo4j Browser at http://localhost:7474
5. Connect using the default credentials (neo4j/neo4j) and set a new password

## Configuration

Basic configuration options can be set in the `.env` file. For more details, see [CONFIGURATION.md](docs/CONFIGURATION.md).

## Usage

After starting the container, you can interact with Neo4j using:

- Neo4j Browser: http://localhost:7474
- Bolt protocol: bolt://localhost:7687

For more advanced usage instructions, refer to the [official Neo4j documentation](https://neo4j.com/docs/).

## Advanced Configuration

For advanced configuration options, including memory settings, logging, and plugin management, see [CONFIGURATION.md](docs/CONFIGURATION.md).

## Data Persistence

Neo4j data is persisted in Docker volumes. By default, these are:

- `/data`: Graph data
- `/logs`: Neo4j logs
- `/import`: Import directory for initial data load
- `/plugins`: Directory for Neo4j plugins

You can customize these in the `docker-compose.yml` file.

## Networking

Neo4j exposes the following ports:

- 7474: HTTP
- 7473: HTTPS
- 7687: Bolt

Ensure these ports are available on your host system.

## Security Considerations

Neo4j has several security features enabled by default. For more information on securing your Neo4j instance, see [SECURITY.md](docs/SECURITY.md).

## Performance Tuning

For tips on optimizing Neo4j performance in Docker, see [PERFORMANCE_TUNING.md](docs/PERFORMANCE_TUNING.md).

## Multi-Node Setup

Neo4j supports clustering for high availability and scalability. For details on setting up a multi-node cluster, see [MULTI_NODE_SETUP.md](docs/MULTI_NODE_SETUP.md).

## Upgrading

For instructions on upgrading your Neo4j Docker setup, see [UPGRADING.md](docs/UPGRADING.md).

## Troubleshooting

For common issues and their solutions, see [TROUBLESHOOTING.md](docs/TROUBLESHOOTING.md).
