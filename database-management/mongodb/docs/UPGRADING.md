# MongoDB Upgrade Guide

This guide provides instructions for upgrading your MongoDB Docker setup to a newer version.

## Before You Begin

1. **Backup Your Data**: Always create a full backup of your data before upgrading.

   ```
   docker exec -it mongodb mongodump --out /data/backup
   ```

2. **Check Compatibility**: Ensure your applications and drivers are compatible with the new MongoDB version.

3. **Review Release Notes**: Check the [MongoDB release notes](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/release-notes/) for any breaking changes or new features.

4. **Plan for Downtime**: Upgrading typically requires some downtime. Plan accordingly.

## Upgrade Process

### 1. Single Instance Upgrade

1. Stop the current MongoDB container:

   ```
   docker-compose down
   ```

2. Update the MongoDB version in your `docker-compose.yml` file:

   ```yaml
   image: mongo:NEW_VERSION
   ```

3. Pull the new MongoDB image:

   ```
   docker-compose pull
   ```

4. Start the container with the new version:

   ```
   docker-compose up -d
   ```

5. Verify the new version:
   ```
   docker exec -it mongodb mongosh --eval "db.version()"
   ```

### 2. Replica Set Upgrade

For a replica set, upgrade the secondary members first, then step down the primary and upgrade it last.

1. Upgrade each secondary member:

   - Stop the secondary member
   - Update its version in `docker-compose.yml`
   - Start the upgraded secondary
   - Wait for it to reach SECONDARY state:
     ```javascript
     rs.status();
     ```

2. Step down the primary:

   ```javascript
   rs.stepDown();
   ```

3. Upgrade the former primary following the same steps as the secondaries.

### 3. Sharded Cluster Upgrade

Upgrade components in this order: config servers, shards, and then mongos routers.

1. Disable the balancer:

   ```javascript
   sh.stopBalancer();
   ```

2. Upgrade config servers (if they're a replica set, follow replica set upgrade procedure)

3. Upgrade each shard (follow replica set upgrade procedure for each shard)

4. Upgrade mongos routers

5. Re-enable the balancer:
   ```javascript
   sh.startBalancer();
   ```

## Post-Upgrade Steps

1. **Verify Functionality**: Run tests to ensure your application works correctly with the new version.

2. **Check Logs**: Review MongoDB logs for any errors or warnings:

   ```
   docker logs mongodb
   ```

3. **Update Drivers**: If necessary, update your application's MongoDB drivers to versions compatible with the new MongoDB version.

4. **Review New Features**: Explore new features or improvements in the upgraded version and consider how they might benefit your application.

## Downgrade Procedure

If you encounter issues and need to downgrade:

1. Stop the MongoDB container
2. Revert the version in your `docker-compose.yml`
3. Start the container with the previous version
4. Restore data from your backup if necessary

Note: Downgrades are not always straightforward and may not be possible between certain versions. Always consult the MongoDB documentation for version-specific downgrade instructions.

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues during or after the upgrade:

1. Check MongoDB logs for error messages
2. Verify that all configuration options are still valid in the new version
3. Ensure all clients and drivers are compatible with the new version
4. Consult the [MongoDB Upgrade Documentation](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/upgrade/) for version-specific troubleshooting advice

Remember, thorough testing in a staging environment that mirrors your production setup is crucial before performing any upgrade in production.
