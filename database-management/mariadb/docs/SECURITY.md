## Access Control

1. **Use strong passwords**: Set strong, unique passwords for all database users, especially the root user.

2. **Principle of least privilege**: Grant users only the permissions they need to perform their tasks.

3. **Remove anonymous users**:

   ```sql
   DELETE FROM mysql.user WHERE User='';
   FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
   ```

4. **Disable remote root login**:
   ```sql
   UPDATE mysql.user SET Host='localhost' WHERE User='root';
   FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
   ```

## Network Security

1. **Restrict network access**: Bind MariaDB to localhost if external access is not required:

   ```yaml
   ports:
     - "127.0.0.1:3306:3306"
   ```

2. **Use a firewall**: Configure your host's firewall to restrict access to the MariaDB port.

3. **Utilize Docker networks**: Use custom Docker networks to isolate your MariaDB container from unnecessary services.

## Data Encryption

1. **Enable TLS/SSL**: Configure MariaDB to use SSL for encrypted connections:

   ```
   [mysqld]
   ssl-cert=/path/to/server-cert.pem
   ssl-key=/path/to/server-key.pem
   ```

2. **Use encrypted volumes**: Consider using Docker's volume encryption features or host-level disk encryption.

## Logging and Auditing

1. **Enable audit logging**: Configure MariaDB's audit plugin to log important events:

   ```
   [mysqld]
   plugin-load-add=server_audit
   server_audit_logging=ON
   ```

2. **Secure log files**: Ensure log files are stored securely and rotated regularly.

## Regular Updates

1. Keep your MariaDB Docker image up-to-date with the latest security patches.
2. Regularly update your host system and Docker engine.

## Secure Configuration

1. **Disable unnecessary features**: Turn off any features or plugins you don't need.

2. **Secure file permissions**: Ensure MariaDB configuration and data files have appropriate permissions.

3. **Use security-enhanced Linux (SELinux) or AppArmor**: These can provide an additional layer of security.

4. **Implement query limits**: Set reasonable limits on query execution time and resource usage:

   ```
   [mysqld]
   max_execution_time=30000
   max_allowed_packet=16M
   ```

5. **Use secure password validation**: Enable and configure the password validation plugin:
   ```
   [mysqld]
   plugin-load-add=simple_password_check
   simple_password_check_minimal_length=8
   ```

Remember, security is an ongoing process. Regularly review and update your security measures, and stay informed about the latest security best practices and vulnerabilities related to MariaDB and Docker.
