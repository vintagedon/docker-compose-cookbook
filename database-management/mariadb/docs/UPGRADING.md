## Before You Begin

- Check the [MariaDB release notes](https://mariadb.com/kb/en/release-notes/) for any breaking changes or deprecated features.
- Ensure you have enough disk space for the upgrade process.
- Plan for potential downtime during the upgrade.

## Backup Your Data

1. Create a full backup of your database:

   ```
   docker exec mariadb mysqldump -u root -p --all-databases > mariadb_backup.sql
   ```

2. Backup your configuration files:
   ```
   docker cp mariadb:/etc/mysql/my.cnf ./my.cnf.backup
   ```

## Upgrading Process

1. Update the MariaDB version in your `.env` file:

   ```
   MARIADB_VERSION=10.7
   ```

2. Pull the new MariaDB image:

   ```
   docker-compose pull
   ```

3. Stop the current MariaDB container:

   ```
   docker-compose down
   ```

4. Start the new MariaDB container:

   ```
   docker-compose up -d
   ```

5. Monitor the logs for any errors:
   ```
   docker-compose logs -f
   ```

## Post-Upgrade Steps

1. Verify the new version:

   ```
   docker exec mariadb mysql -u root -p -e "SELECT VERSION();"
   ```

2. Run mysql_upgrade to update system tables:

   ```
   docker exec -it mariadb mysql_upgrade -u root -p
   ```

3. Check for any deprecated features or syntax in your custom scripts or applications.

4. Test your applications thoroughly to ensure compatibility with the new version.

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: Container fails to start after upgrade

1. Check the Docker logs:

   ```
   docker-compose logs
   ```

2. Verify that your custom configurations are still compatible with the new version.

3. If needed, revert to the previous version and restore from backup:
   ```
   MARIADB_VERSION=<previous_version>
   docker-compose up -d
   docker exec -i mariadb mysql -u root -p < mariadb_backup.sql
   ```

### Issue: Slow performance after upgrade

1. Review and adjust your MariaDB configuration for the new version.
2. Check for any new features or optimizations you can leverage in the new version.

### Issue: Application incompatibility

1. Review the MariaDB changelog for any breaking changes.
2. Update your application code to be compatible with the new MariaDB version.

Remember, it's always a good practice to test the upgrade process in a staging environment before applying it to your production system. If you encounter any issues not covered in this guide, consult the [official MariaDB documentation](https://mariadb.com/kb/en/documentation/) or seek help from the MariaDB community forums.
