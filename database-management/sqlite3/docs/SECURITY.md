## File System Security

1. **File Permissions**: Ensure that the SQLite database file has appropriate permissions. Only the necessary users/processes should have read/write access.

2. **Secure Storage**: Store the SQLite database file in a secure location, preferably outside the web root if used in a web application.

3. **Backup Security**: Secure your database backups with encryption and access controls.

## Access Control

1. **Authentication**: While SQLite doesn't have built-in user authentication, implement application-level authentication for database access.

2. **Authorization**: Implement proper authorization checks in your application to control access to sensitive data.

## SQL Injection Prevention

1. **Prepared Statements**: Always use prepared statements or parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection attacks.

2. **Input Validation**: Validate and sanitize all user inputs before using them in SQL queries.

3. **Least Privilege**: Use database accounts with the least necessary privileges for your application.

## Encryption

1. **Database Encryption**: Consider using SQLite Encryption Extension (SEE) or third-party solutions for database-level encryption.

2. **Transport Encryption**: If accessing the database remotely, ensure that the connection is encrypted (e.g., SSH tunnel).

## Docker Security

1. **Image Security**: Use official or trusted Docker images. Regularly update to the latest secure versions.

2. **Container Isolation**: Run SQLite containers with appropriate isolation. Avoid using the `--privileged` flag unless absolutely necessary.

3. **Resource Limits**: Set resource limits for your containers to prevent DoS attacks.

4. **Network Security**: Use Docker networks to isolate containers. Expose ports only when necessary.

5. **Secrets Management**: Use Docker secrets or environment variables to manage sensitive information like encryption keys.

## Reporting Security Issues

If you discover any security-related issues, please email [security@example.com] instead of using the public issue tracker. We appreciate your efforts to responsibly disclose your findings.

Please note that while SQLite is generally secure, it's designed for local storage in trusted environments. If you need a database system with more robust security features for multi-user or networked environments, consider using a full-fledged database management system like PostgreSQL or MySQL.
