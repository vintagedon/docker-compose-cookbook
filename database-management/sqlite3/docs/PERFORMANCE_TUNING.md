## SQLite3 Performance Optimization

1. **Use WAL Mode**: Enable Write-Ahead Logging for better concurrency.

   ```sql
   PRAGMA journal_mode = WAL;
   ```

2. **Adjust Synchronous Setting**: Balance between safety and performance.

   ```sql
   PRAGMA synchronous = NORMAL;
   ```

3. **Use Prepared Statements**: Reuse compiled SQL statements for better performance.

4. **Create Indexes**: Add indexes on columns used frequently in WHERE clauses and joins.

   ```sql
   CREATE INDEX idx_column_name ON table_name(column_name);
   ```

5. **Optimize Queries**: Use EXPLAIN QUERY PLAN to analyze and optimize complex queries.

6. **Bulk Inserts**: Use transactions for bulk inserts.

   ```sql
   BEGIN TRANSACTION;
   -- Multiple INSERT statements
   COMMIT;
   ```

7. **Optimize Database Schema**: Normalize your schema appropriately and use appropriate data types.

8. **Vacuum Regularly**: Run VACUUM periodically to optimize database file structure.
   ```sql
   VACUUM;
   ```

## Docker Performance Considerations

1. **Volume Mounting**: Use volume mounts for the SQLite database file to ensure data persistence and reduce I/O overhead.

2. **Resource Allocation**: Allocate appropriate CPU and memory resources to the Docker container.

3. **Network Mode**: Use `host` network mode if possible for better network performance.

4. **Storage Driver**: Choose an appropriate storage driver (e.g., overlay2) for better performance.

## Monitoring and Profiling

1. **SQLite Query Analyzer**: Use the SQLite query analyzer to identify slow queries.

   ```sql
   EXPLAIN QUERY PLAN SELECT ...;
   ```

2. **Docker Stats**: Monitor container resource usage with `docker stats`.

3. **Profiling Tools**: Use profiling tools like `perf` or `strace` to identify performance bottlenecks.

4. **Logging**: Enable and analyze SQLite logs for performance-related issues.

Remember to test thoroughly in a staging environment before applying performance optimizations to production. Each application has unique characteristics, so not all optimizations may be suitable for every use case.
