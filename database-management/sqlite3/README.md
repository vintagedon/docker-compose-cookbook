# SQLite3 Docker Setup

[![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-yellow.svg)](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT)

SQLite is a C library that provides a lightweight disk-based database that doesn't require a separate server process and allows accessing the database using a nonstandard variant of the SQL query language. It's a popular choice for local/client storage in application software such as web browsers, operating systems, and mobile phones.

## Prerequisites

- Docker
- Docker Compose

## Quick Start

1. Clone this repository
2. Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and adjust the variables as needed
3. Run `docker-compose up -d`
4. Connect to the SQLite database using the command:
   ```
   docker exec -it sqlite3 sqlite3 /data/db.sqlite
   ```

## Configuration

See the [CONFIGURATION.md](docs/CONFIGURATION.md) file for detailed configuration options.

## Usage

To use SQLite3 in your Docker container:

1. Start the container using `docker-compose up -d`
2. Connect to the SQLite database using:
   ```
   docker exec -it sqlite3 sqlite3 /data/db.sqlite
   ```
3. Run SQL commands as needed

For more detailed usage instructions, refer to the [official SQLite documentation](https://www.sqlite.org/docs.html).

## Advanced Configuration

For advanced configuration options, including performance tuning and security considerations, please refer to the following documents:

- [PERFORMANCE_TUNING.md](docs/PERFORMANCE_TUNING.md)
- [SECURITY.md](docs/SECURITY.md)

## Data Persistence

SQLite data is persisted in the `/data` directory inside the container, which is mapped to a Docker volume. This ensures that your data remains intact even if the container is stopped or removed.

## Upgrading

For information on upgrading SQLite3 in your Docker setup, please refer to [UPGRADING.md](docs/UPGRADING.md).

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues, please check the [TROUBLESHOOTING.md](docs/TROUBLESHOOTING.md) guide for common problems and their solutions.
