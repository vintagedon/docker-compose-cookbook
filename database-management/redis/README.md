## Prerequisites

- Docker
- Docker Compose
- At least 1GB of free memory

## Quick Start

1. Clone this repository
2. Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and adjust the variables as needed
3. Run `docker-compose up -d`
4. Connect to Redis using `redis-cli` or your preferred Redis client

## Configuration

See [CONFIGURATION.md](docs/CONFIGURATION.md) for detailed information on configuring your Redis instance.

## Usage

Basic usage instructions:

1. Connect to Redis:
   ```
   redis-cli -h localhost -p 6379
   ```
2. Set a key-value pair:
   ```
   SET mykey "Hello, Redis!"
   ```
3. Get the value:
   ```
   GET mykey
   ```

For more advanced usage, refer to the [official Redis documentation](https://redis.io/documentation).

## Advanced Configuration

For advanced configuration options, including persistence, replication, and clustering, see [CONFIGURATION.md](docs/CONFIGURATION.md).

## Data Persistence

Redis supports various persistence options. By default, this setup uses RDB (Redis Database) snapshots. For more information on configuring persistence, see [CONFIGURATION.md](docs/CONFIGURATION.md).

## Networking

By default, Redis is accessible on localhost:6379. To change this or configure Redis for remote access, see [CONFIGURATION.md](docs/CONFIGURATION.md).

## Security Considerations

Redis is designed to be accessed by trusted clients inside trusted environments. For security best practices, including authentication and encryption, see [SECURITY.md](docs/SECURITY.md).

## Performance Tuning

For tips on optimizing Redis performance, see [PERFORMANCE_TUNING.md](docs/PERFORMANCE_TUNING.md).

## Multi-Node Setup

For information on setting up Redis in a cluster or replication mode, see [MULTI_NODE_SETUP.md](docs/MULTI_NODE_SETUP.md).

## Upgrading

For instructions on upgrading your Redis instance, see [UPGRADING.md](docs/UPGRADING.md).

## Troubleshooting

For common issues and their solutions, see [TROUBLESHOOTING.md](docs/TROUBLESHOOTING.md).
