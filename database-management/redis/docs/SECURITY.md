## Overview

Redis is designed to be accessed by trusted clients inside trusted environments. Proper security measures are crucial, especially when exposed to the internet.

## Configuration Options

- `requirepass`: Set authentication password
- `bind`: Bind to specific interfaces
- `protected-mode`: Protect Redis from attacks from the external network
- `rename-command`: Rename or disable dangerous commands

## Best Practices

1. Always set a strong password using `requirepass`.
2. Bind Redis to localhost if possible, use a reverse proxy for remote access.
3. Enable protected-mode when binding to any interface.
4. Disable or rename dangerous commands like FLUSHALL, CONFIG in production.
5. Use encryption (TLS) for data in transit.
6. Regularly update to the latest Redis version.
7. Implement proper firewall rules.

## Examples

### Basic Security Setup

```yaml
version: "3"
services:
  redis:
    image: redis:6.2
    command: redis-server --requirepass ${REDIS_PASSWORD} --bind 127.0.0.1 --protected-mode yes
    environment:
      - REDIS_PASSWORD=your_strong_password_here
```

### Advanced Security with Command Renaming

Create a `redis.conf` file with:

```
requirepass your_strong_password_here
bind 127.0.0.1
protected-mode yes
rename-command FLUSHALL ""
rename-command CONFIG ""
```

Then use it in your Docker Compose:

```yaml
version: "3"
services:
  redis:
    image: redis:6.2
    command: redis-server /usr/local/etc/redis/redis.conf
    volumes:
      - ./redis.conf:/usr/local/etc/redis/redis.conf
```

## Troubleshooting

- If you can't connect, ensure the password is correct and the client is allowed by the `bind` setting.
- Check Redis logs for any security-related warnings or errors.
- Use `redis-cli` with the `-a` flag to test authentication.
