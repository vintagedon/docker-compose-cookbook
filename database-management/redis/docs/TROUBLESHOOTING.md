## Overview

When troubleshooting Redis in a Docker environment, issues often relate to configuration, networking, or resource constraints.

## Common Issues

### 1. Redis Container Won't Start

**Symptoms:**

- Container exits immediately after starting
- Docker logs show error messages

**Potential Solutions:**

- Check Docker logs: `docker logs <container_name>`
- Verify Redis configuration file syntax
- Ensure Redis has write permissions to its data directory

### 2. Can't Connect to Redis

**Symptoms:**

- Redis clients can't establish a connection
- Connection timeouts

**Potential Solutions:**

- Verify Redis is running: `docker ps`
- Check port mapping in docker-compose.yml
- Ensure Redis is not bound to localhost if connecting remotely
- Verify firewall settings

### 3. Authentication Failures

**Symptoms:**

- "NOAUTH Authentication required" errors

**Potential Solutions:**

- Verify the correct password is set in the Redis configuration
- Ensure clients are using the correct password
- Check if the `requirepass` directive is set in redis.conf

### 4. Performance Issues

**Symptoms:**

- Slow response times
- High CPU or memory usage

**Potential Solutions:**

- Monitor Redis metrics using INFO command
- Check for slow queries using SLOWLOG
- Adjust maxmemory and maxmemory-policy settings
- Consider scaling horizontally with Redis Cluster

## Diagnostic Tools

1. Redis CLI: `docker exec -it <container_name> redis-cli`
2. Redis INFO command: Provides information on server stats
3. Docker logs: `docker logs <container_name>`
4. Docker stats: `docker stats <container_name>`

## Best Practices

1. Always check logs when troubleshooting
2. Use Redis monitoring tools to track performance
3. Regularly backup Redis data
4. Keep Redis and Docker versions up to date
5. Document your configuration for easier debugging
