## 📁 General Structure

Each database setup in this section typically follows this structure:

```
database-name/
├── docker-compose.yml
├── .env.example
├── README.md
└── config/
    └── (database-specific configuration files)
```

## 🚀 Usage

To use any of the database setups in this section:

1. Navigate to the desired database's directory
2. Copy the `.env.example` file to `.env` and configure as needed
3. Run the Docker Compose command

For example, to set up MySQL:

```bash
cd mysql
cp .env.example .env
nano .env  # Edit settings as needed
docker-compose up -d
```

Refer to each database's README for specific instructions, configuration details, and connection information.

## 🔒 Security Considerations

When working with databases, keep these security practices in mind:

- Use strong, unique passwords for all database instances
- Implement proper firewall rules and network segmentation
- Regularly update Docker images and host systems
- Enable encryption for data at rest and in transit when supported
- Implement proper access controls and user management
- Regularly backup your databases and test restoration procedures
- Monitor database logs for suspicious activities
- Use least privilege principle when creating database users and roles
- Disable unnecessary database features and services
