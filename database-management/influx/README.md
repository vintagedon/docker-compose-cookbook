# InfluxDB Docker Setup

[![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-yellow.svg)](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT)

InfluxDB is an open-source time series database designed to handle high write and query loads. It is optimized for fast, high-availability storage and retrieval of time series data in fields such as operations monitoring, application metrics, Internet of Things sensor data, and real-time analytics.

## Prerequisites

- Docker Engine 20.10.0 or later
- Docker Compose 1.29.0 or later
- At least 2GB of RAM
- Sufficient disk space for your time series data

## Installation

1. Clone this repository:

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/influxdb-docker-setup.git
   cd influxdb-docker-setup
   ```

2. Copy the example environment file and adjust the values as needed:

   ```
   cp .env.example .env
   ```

3. Start the InfluxDB container:
   ```
   docker-compose up -d
   ```

## Usage

After installation, InfluxDB will be available on `http://localhost:8086` (or the port you specified in the `.env` file).

To use the InfluxDB CLI:

```
docker-compose exec influxdb influx
```

For more detailed usage instructions, please refer to the [official InfluxDB documentation](https://docs.influxdata.com/).

## Configuration

Basic configuration options are available in the `.env` file. For more advanced configurations, please refer to the `CONFIGURATION.md` file in the `docs` directory.

## Advanced Configuration

For detailed information on advanced configuration options, including custom InfluxDB configurations and environment variables, please see the `CONFIGURATION.md` file in the `docs` directory.

## Data Persistence

Data is persisted in a Docker volume named `influxdb_data`. This ensures that your data survives container restarts and removals.

## Networking

By default, InfluxDB is accessible on localhost. If you need to access it from other containers or external services, you may need to adjust the network settings in the `docker-compose.yml` file.

## Security

For security best practices and configuration options, please refer to the `SECURITY.md` file in the `docs` directory.

## Performance Tuning

To optimize InfluxDB performance for your specific use case, see the `PERFORMANCE_TUNING.md` file in the `docs` directory.

## Multi-Node Setup

For information on setting up a multi-node InfluxDB cluster, please refer to the `MULTI_NODE_SETUP.md` file in the `docs` directory.

## Upgrading

For instructions on upgrading your InfluxDB Docker setup, please see the `UPGRADING.md` file in the `docs` directory.

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues, please check the `TROUBLESHOOTING.md` file in the `docs` directory for common problems and their solutions.

## Known Limitations

- This setup is primarily designed for single-node deployments. For production multi-node setups, additional configuration may be required.
- The default configuration may not be optimal for all use cases. Please refer to the performance tuning guide for optimization tips.

## Contributing

We welcome contributions! Please see the `CONTRIBUTING.md` file in the `docs` directory for details on how to contribute to this project.

## License

This project is licensed under the MIT License - see the `LICENSE` file for details.

## Expected Output

After starting the container, you should see output similar to this:

```
$ docker-compose up -d
Creating network "influxdb_network" with the default driver
Creating volume "influxdb_data" with default driver
Creating influxdb ... done

$ docker-compose ps
Name               Command               State                    Ports
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
influxdb   /entrypoint.sh influxd      Up      0.0.0.0:8086->8086/tcp,:::8086->8086/tcp
```

## Disclaimer

This Docker setup is provided as-is, and while we strive to keep it up-to-date and secure, we recommend always referring to the [official InfluxDB documentation](https://docs.influxdata.com/) for the most current information and best practices.
