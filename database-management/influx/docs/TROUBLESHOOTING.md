# Troubleshooting Guide for InfluxDB Docker Setup

This guide provides solutions to common issues you might encounter when using the InfluxDB Docker setup.

## Container Fails to Start

**Issue**: The InfluxDB container fails to start or exits immediately after starting.

**Solutions**:

1. Check the container logs:
   ```
   docker-compose logs influxdb
   ```
2. Ensure you have the correct permissions on the data directory.
3. Verify that the ports specified in `docker-compose.yml` are not already in use.

## Unable to Connect to InfluxDB

**Issue**: You can't connect to InfluxDB from your application or the CLI.

**Solutions**:

1. Verify that the container is running:
   ```
   docker-compose ps
   ```
2. Check if the correct ports are exposed:
   ```
   docker-compose port influxdb 8086
   ```
3. Ensure your firewall is not blocking the connection.
4. Verify the connection string in your application.

## Authentication Failures

**Issue**: You're unable to authenticate with InfluxDB.

**Solutions**:

1. Double-check your username and password.
2. Ensure you're using the correct token for API authentication.
3. Verify that authentication is properly configured in your `.env` file.

## Performance Issues

**Issue**: InfluxDB is running slowly or consuming excessive resources.

**Solutions**:

1. Check system resources:
   ```
   docker stats influxdb
   ```
2. Review your InfluxDB configuration for performance settings.
3. Optimize your queries and data model.
4. Consider scaling your hardware or using a multi-node setup for large datasets.

## Data Loss or Corruption

**Issue**: You're experiencing data loss or corruption.

**Solutions**:

1. Check the InfluxDB logs for any error messages related to data integrity.
2. Verify that you have sufficient disk space.
3. Ensure that you're not exceeding InfluxDB's series cardinality limits.
4. Restore from a recent backup if available.

## Upgrade Issues

**Issue**: Problems occur after upgrading InfluxDB.

**Solutions**:

1. Review the changelog for any breaking changes.
2. Ensure compatibility between your client libraries and the new InfluxDB version.
3. Consider rolling back to the previous version if issues persist.

## Backup and Restore Problems

**Issue**: Unable to create backups or restore from a backup.

**Solutions**:

1. Verify that you have sufficient disk space for backups.
2. Ensure you have the necessary permissions to write to the backup location.
3. Check that you're using the correct syntax for the backup and restore commands.

## High Memory Usage

**Issue**: InfluxDB is consuming more memory than expected.

**Solutions**:

1. Adjust the cache size settings in your InfluxDB configuration.
2. Implement appropriate retention policies to manage data volume.
3. Consider upgrading your hardware or scaling horizontally if dealing with large datasets.

## Slow Queries

**Issue**: Certain queries are running very slowly.

**Solutions**:

1. Use the `EXPLAIN` command to analyze query performance.
2. Optimize your data model and indexing strategy.
3. Consider using continuous queries for frequently-run aggregate queries.
