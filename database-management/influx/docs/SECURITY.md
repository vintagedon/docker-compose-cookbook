# Security Guidelines for InfluxDB Docker Setup

This document outlines security best practices for your InfluxDB Docker setup. Following these guidelines will help protect your data and ensure the integrity of your InfluxDB instance.

## Authentication and Authorization

1. **Enable Authentication**: Always enable authentication for your InfluxDB instance. This is done by default in our setup.

2. **Use Strong Passwords**: Ensure that all user passwords, especially for admin accounts, are strong and unique.

3. **Token-Based Authentication**: Use tokens for authenticating API requests instead of passwords when possible.

4. **Implement Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**: Assign appropriate permissions to users based on their roles.

## Network Security

1. **Firewall Configuration**: Limit access to the InfluxDB port (default 8086) to only necessary IP addresses or ranges.

2. **Use TLS/SSL**: Enable HTTPS for all communications with InfluxDB. Update your `docker-compose.yml` to include:

   ```yaml
   services:
     influxdb:
       # ... other configurations ...
       environment:
         - INFLUXDB_HTTP_HTTPS_ENABLED=true
         - INFLUXDB_HTTP_HTTPS_CERTIFICATE=/etc/ssl/influxdb-selfsigned.crt
         - INFLUXDB_HTTP_HTTPS_PRIVATE_KEY=/etc/ssl/influxdb-selfsigned.key
       volumes:
         - ./ssl:/etc/ssl
   ```

   Generate self-signed certificates or use Let's Encrypt for valid certificates.

3. **Separate Networks**: If using in a larger Docker setup, consider placing InfluxDB on a separate internal network.

## Data Protection

1. **Encryption at Rest**: Consider using filesystem-level encryption for the volume where InfluxDB data is stored.

2. **Regular Backups**: Implement a backup strategy. You can use the `influx backup` command:

   ```bash
   docker exec influxdb influx backup /path/to/backup
   ```

3. **Audit Logging**: Enable audit logging to track all requests made to the database:

   ```yaml
   services:
     influxdb:
       # ... other configurations ...
       environment:
         - INFLUXDB_AUDIT_LOG_ENABLED=true
   ```

## Container Security

1. **Use Official Images**: Always use official InfluxDB Docker images from trusted sources.

2. **Keep InfluxDB Updated**: Regularly update to the latest stable version of InfluxDB to get security patches.

3. **Limit Container Capabilities**: Run the InfluxDB container with minimal required capabilities.

4. **Non-Root User**: Consider running InfluxDB as a non-root user inside the container.

## Monitoring and Incident Response

1. **Enable Monitoring**: Use InfluxDB's built-in monitoring features to track unusual activities.

2. **Set Up Alerts**: Configure alerts for suspicious activities or performance issues.

3. **Incident Response Plan**: Develop and maintain an incident response plan specific to your InfluxDB setup.

## Regular Security Audits

1. **Conduct Regular Reviews**: Periodically review your InfluxDB setup for security best practices.

2. **Stay Informed**: Keep up-to-date with the latest security advisories for InfluxDB and related technologies.

Remember, security is an ongoing process. Regularly review and update your security measures to protect against new threats.
