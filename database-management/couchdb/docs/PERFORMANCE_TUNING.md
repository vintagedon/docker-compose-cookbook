# Performance Tuning Guide for CouchDB Docker Setup

This guide provides tips and best practices for optimizing the performance of your CouchDB Docker setup.

## Hardware Considerations

- **CPU**: CouchDB can benefit from multiple cores for concurrent operations.
- **Memory**: Allocate enough RAM to keep frequently accessed data in memory.
- **Storage**: Use SSDs for better I/O performance, especially for write-heavy workloads.

## Docker Configuration

1. **Resource Limits**:
   Set appropriate CPU and memory limits in your `docker-compose.yml`:

   ```yaml
   services:
     couchdb:
       # ... other configurations ...
       deploy:
         resources:
           limits:
             cpus: "2"
             memory: 4G
   ```

2. **Volume Performance**:
   Use volume drivers optimized for your storage system. For example, if using local SSDs:

   ```yaml
   volumes:
     couchdb_data:
       driver: local
       driver_opts:
         type: "none"
         o: "bind"
         device: "/path/to/fast/storage"
   ```

## CouchDB Configuration

1. **Concurrency Settings**:
   Adjust the number of HTTP connections and Erlang processes:

   ```
   COUCHDB_MAX_HTTP_CONNECTIONS=2048
   ERL_MAX_PORTS=2048
   ```

2. **Compaction Settings**:
   Enable automatic compaction to reclaim space and improve query performance:

   ```
   [compactions]
   _default = [{db_fragmentation, "70%"}, {view_fragmentation, "60%"}]
   ```

3. **View Settings**:
   Optimize view performance:

   ```
   [query_server_config]
   reduce_limit = false

   [view_compaction]
   keyvalue_buffer_size = 2097152
   ```

4. **Caching**:
   Adjust caching parameters based on your available memory:

   ```
   [couchdb]
   os_process_timeout = 5000
   max_dbs_open = 500

   [couch_httpd_auth]
   cache_size = 200
   ```

## Indexing and Querying

1. **Design Document Optimization**:

   - Use `emit(null, doc)` in map functions to create smaller indexes.
   - Implement efficient reduce functions.

2. **Partitioned Queries**:
   Use partitioned databases for large datasets to improve query performance.

3. **Avoid Using `include_docs`**:
   Instead of using `include_docs=true`, emit necessary document fields in your view.

## Monitoring and Profiling

1. **ELK Stack**:
   Set up Elasticsearch, Logstash, and Kibana for comprehensive logging and monitoring.

2. **Prometheus and Grafana**:
   Use Prometheus to collect metrics and Grafana for visualization.

3. **CouchDB Built-in Profiler**:
   Enable the built-in profiler for detailed performance analysis:

   ```
   [log]
   level = debug

   [couch_httpd_misc]
   enable_profiler = true
   ```

## Regular Maintenance

1. **Compaction**:
   Regularly compact databases and views:

   ```
   curl -X POST http://admin:password@localhost:5984/dbname/_compact
   curl -X POST http://admin:password@localhost:5984/dbname/_view_cleanup
   ```

2. **Monitoring Disk Space**:
   Implement alerts for low disk space conditions.

3. **Backup and Restore**:
   Regularly test your backup and restore procedures to ensure data integrity.

Remember to test these optimizations in a staging environment before applying them to production. Performance tuning is an iterative process, and the optimal configuration can vary based on your specific use case and workload.
