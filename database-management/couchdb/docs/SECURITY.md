# Security Guide for CouchDB Docker Setup

This document outlines security best practices for your CouchDB Docker setup.

## 1. Authentication

Always set up authentication for your CouchDB instance:

1. Set strong admin credentials in your `.env` file:

   ```
   COUCHDB_USER=admin
   COUCHDB_PASSWORD=strong_password_here
   ```

2. Use these credentials for all administrative tasks.

3. Create separate users for applications with limited permissions.

## 2. Network Security

1. Avoid exposing CouchDB directly to the internet. Use a reverse proxy like Nginx.

2. If you must expose CouchDB, limit access to specific IP addresses in your firewall rules.

3. Use Docker networks to isolate your CouchDB container:
   ```yaml
   networks:
     couchdb_net:
       internal: true
   ```

## 3. SSL/TLS Configuration

Enable HTTPS to encrypt data in transit:

1. Generate SSL certificates (use Let's Encrypt for production).

2. Update your `docker-compose.yml`:

   ```yaml
   volumes:
     - ./certs:/opt/couchdb/etc/certs
   environment:
     - COUCHDB_CERT_FILE=/opt/couchdb/etc/certs/cert.pem
     - COUCHDB_KEY_FILE=/opt/couchdb/etc/certs/key.pem
   ```

3. Configure CouchDB to use HTTPS in your `local.ini`:
   ```ini
   [ssl]
   enable = true
   ```

## 4. Data Encryption

1. Use volume encryption to protect data at rest:

   ```yaml
   volumes:
     couchdb_data:
       driver: local
       driver_opts:
         type: "ext4"
         device: "/dev/xvdf"
         o: "encrypt"
   ```

2. For cloud deployments, use provider-specific encryption options.

## 5. Regular Updates

1. Keep your CouchDB image up-to-date:

   ```yaml
   image: couchdb:latest
   ```

2. Regularly update your host system and Docker installation.

## 6. Monitoring and Logging

1. Enable detailed logging:

   ```yaml
   environment:
     - COUCHDB_LOG_LEVEL=warning
   ```

2. Use a centralized logging system (e.g., ELK stack) for log analysis.

3. Implement intrusion detection systems (IDS) to monitor for suspicious activities.

## 7. Backup and Disaster Recovery

1. Regularly backup your data and test restoration processes.

2. Store backups securely, preferably encrypted and off-site.

## 8. Principle of Least Privilege

1. Run the CouchDB container as a non-root user:

   ```yaml
   user: "5984:5984"
   ```

2. Limit container capabilities:
   ```yaml
   cap_drop:
     - ALL
   cap_add:
     - NET_BIND_SERVICE
   ```

## 9. Security Audits

1. Regularly perform security audits of your setup.

2. Use tools like Docker Bench for Security to check your Docker configuration.

Remember, security is an ongoing process. Stay informed about the latest security best practices and vulnerabilities related to CouchDB and Docker.
