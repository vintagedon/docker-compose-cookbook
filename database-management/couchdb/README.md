## Prerequisites

- Docker Engine (version 19.03.0+)
- Docker Compose (version 1.27.0+)

## Installation

1. Clone this repository:

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/couchdb-docker-setup.git
   cd couchdb-docker-setup
   ```

2. Copy the example environment file and modify it as needed:

   ```
   cp .env.example .env
   ```

3. Start the CouchDB container:
   ```
   docker-compose up -d
   ```

## Usage

After installation, CouchDB will be available at `http://localhost:5984`. You can access the web interface at `http://localhost:5984/_utils`.

To create a new database:

```
curl -X PUT http://localhost:5984/mydb
```

To add a document:

```
curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"name": "John Doe"}' http://localhost:5984/mydb
```

## Configuration

Basic configuration options are available in the `.env` file. For more detailed configuration, refer to the `docs/CONFIGURATION.md` file.

## Advanced Configuration

For advanced configuration options, including replication and clustering, see `docs/CONFIGURATION.md`.

## Data Persistence

Data is persisted in a Docker volume. You can back up this volume or mount a local directory for easier management.

## Networking

CouchDB is exposed on port 5984 by default. You can change this in the `docker-compose.yml` file if needed.

## Security

For security best practices, including setting up admin users and SSL/TLS, refer to `docs/SECURITY.md`.

## Performance Tuning

For tips on optimizing CouchDB performance, see `docs/PERFORMANCE_TUNING.md`.

## Multi-Node Setup

Instructions for setting up a CouchDB cluster can be found in `docs/MULTI_NODE_SETUP.md`.

## Upgrading

For upgrade procedures, refer to `docs/UPGRADING.md`.

## Troubleshooting

Common issues and their solutions are documented in `docs/TROUBLESHOOTING.md`.

## Known Limitations

- This setup is primarily designed for development and testing. For production use, additional security measures should be implemented.
- The default configuration may not be optimal for high-load scenarios. Refer to the performance tuning guide for optimizations.

## Contributing

We welcome contributions! Please see `docs/CONTRIBUTING.md` for details on how to get started.

## License

## Expected Output

After running `docker-compose up -d`, you should see output similar to:

```
Creating couchdb ... done
```

You can verify the container is running with:

```
$ docker ps
CONTAINER ID   IMAGE                  COMMAND                  CREATED          STATUS          PORTS                                        NAMES
abcdef123456   couchdb:latest         "tini -- /docker-ent…"   10 seconds ago   Up 9 seconds    0.0.0.0:5984->5984/tcp, :::5984->5984/tcp    couchdb
```
