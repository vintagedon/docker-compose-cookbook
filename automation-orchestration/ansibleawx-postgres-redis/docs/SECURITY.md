# Security Guide for Ansible AWX Docker Setup

This document outlines best practices and recommendations for securing your Ansible AWX Docker installation.

## Authentication and Access Control

1. Change default credentials:

   - Modify the `AWX_ADMIN_USER` and `AWX_ADMIN_PASSWORD` in the `.env` file.
   - Update these credentials immediately after first login.

2. Implement strong password policies:

   - Enforce minimum password length and complexity.
   - Enable password rotation policies.

3. Use LDAP or SAML for centralized authentication:

   - Configure LDAP/SAML in AWX settings.
   - Implement multi-factor authentication (MFA) when possible.

4. Implement role-based access control (RBAC):
   - Create custom roles with least privilege principles.
   - Regularly audit user permissions and remove unnecessary access.

## Network Security

1. Use HTTPS:

   - Generate SSL/TLS certificates (Let's Encrypt recommended).
   - Update `docker-compose.yml` to use SSL certificates.
   - Force HTTPS redirects.

2. Implement firewall rules:

   - Restrict access to AWX ports (8052 for web, 8053 for websockets).
   - Use iptables or cloud provider security groups.

3. Use a reverse proxy:

   - Implement Nginx or Apache as a reverse proxy.
   - Configure proper headers (X-Frame-Options, Content-Security-Policy, etc.).

4. Secure database access:
   - Restrict PostgreSQL access to only AWX containers.
   - Use strong, unique passwords for database users.

## Container Security

1. Keep images updated:

   - Regularly update AWX and dependencies to the latest stable versions.
   - Implement a process for applying security patches.

2. Scan containers for vulnerabilities:

   - Use tools like Trivy or Clair for container scanning.
   - Implement CI/CD pipelines to automate security scans.

3. Implement least privilege principles:

   - Run containers as non-root users when possible.
   - Use read-only file systems where applicable.

4. Secure Docker daemon:
   - Use TLS for Docker daemon communication.
   - Restrict access to Docker socket.

## Data Protection

1. Encrypt sensitive data:

   - Use AWX's built-in encryption for credentials and sensitive variables.
   - Implement disk encryption for volumes containing sensitive data.

2. Implement proper backup procedures:

   - Regularly backup AWX data and configurations.
   - Store backups securely and test restoration processes.

3. Manage secrets securely:
   - Use external secret management solutions (e.g., HashiCorp Vault).
   - Avoid storing secrets in plaintext files or environment variables.

## Monitoring and Logging

1. Enable and configure logging:

   - Centralize logs using ELK stack or similar solutions.
   - Implement log rotation to prevent disk space issues.

2. Monitor for security events:

   - Use SIEM solutions to detect and alert on suspicious activities.
   - Regularly review AWX audit logs.

3. Implement intrusion detection/prevention systems (IDS/IPS):
   - Use tools like Snort or Suricata to monitor network traffic.
   - Configure alerts for potential security threats.

## Compliance and Auditing

1. Implement compliance checks:

   - Use AWX to run regular compliance scans (e.g., CIS benchmarks).
   - Document and address any compliance gaps.

2. Conduct regular security audits:

   - Perform internal and external security assessments.
   - Address findings and implement recommended security controls.

3. Maintain an incident response plan:
   - Document procedures for handling security incidents.
   - Conduct regular drills to ensure readiness.

Remember that security is an ongoing process. Regularly review and update your security measures to address new threats and vulnerabilities. Always refer to the [official Ansible AWX documentation](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible-tower/) for the most up-to-date security recommendations.
