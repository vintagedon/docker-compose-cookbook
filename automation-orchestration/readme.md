## 📁 General Structure

Each tool in this section typically follows this structure:

```
tool-name/
├── docker-compose.yml
├── .env.example
├── README.md
└── config/
    └── (tool-specific configuration files)
```

## 🚀 Usage

To use any of the setups in this section:

1. Navigate to the desired tool's directory
2. Copy the `.env.example` file to `.env` and configure as needed
3. Run the Docker Compose command

For example, to set up Ansible AWX:

```bash
cd ansibleawx-postgres-redis
cp .env.example .env
nano .env  # Edit settings as needed
docker-compose up -d
```

Refer to each tool's README for specific instructions and configuration details.

## 🔒 Security Considerations

When working with automation and orchestration tools, keep these security practices in mind:

- Use strong, unique passwords for all services
- Implement proper firewall rules and network segmentation
- Regularly update Docker images and host systems
- Use HTTPS for web interfaces and encrypt communication between services
- Implement proper access controls and user management
- Regularly audit automation tasks and their permissions
- Use secure secret management practices
