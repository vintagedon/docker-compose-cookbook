# Automation and Orchestration

Welcome to the Automation and Orchestration section of the docker-compose-cookbook! This directory contains Docker Compose configurations for setting up various automation and orchestration tools to streamline your workflow and infrastructure management.

## Available Setups

| Tool | Description | Repo Link |
|------|-------------|-----------|
| Ansible AWX (with Postgres and Redis) | Web UI for Ansible with PostgreSQL and Redis | [ansibleawx-postgres-redis](https://github.com/vintagedon/docker-compose-cookbook/tree/main/automation-orchestration/ansibleawx-postgres-redis) |
| Rundeck | Job scheduler and runbook automation | [rundeck](https://github.com/vintagedon/docker-compose-cookbook/tree/main/automation-orchestration/rundeck) |
| Stackstorm (with MongoDB, RabbitMQ, and Postgres) | Event-driven automation platform | [stackstorm-mongodb-rabbitmq-postgres](https://github.com/vintagedon/docker-compose-cookbook/tree/main/automation-orchestration/stackstorm-mongodb-rabbitmq-postgres) |

## General Structure

Each subdirectory typically contains the following files:

- `docker-compose.yml`: The main configuration file for the Docker services
- `.env`: Environment variables file (you may need to create this)
- Additional configuration files specific to the tool

## Usage

To use any of these setups, follow these general steps:

1. Navigate to the desired tool's directory
2. Create and configure the `.env` file if necessary
3. Run the Docker Compose command to start the services

For example, to set up Ansible AWX:

```bash
cd ansibleawx-postgres-redis
cp .env.example .env  # Create .env file from example if available
nano .env  # Edit the .env file to configure your settings
docker-compose up -d
```

Refer to the specific README in each tool's directory for detailed instructions and configuration options.

## Security Considerations

When working with automation and orchestration tools, keep these security practices in mind:

- Regularly update your Docker images and host system
- Use strong, unique passwords for all services
- Implement proper firewall rules to control access
- Be cautious when exposing services to the internet
- Regularly audit your configurations and logs
- Implement proper access controls and user management
- Secure your automation workflows and scripts
- Use encrypted connections (HTTPS, SSH) whenever possible
- Be mindful of the permissions granted to automation tasks
- Implement proper secrets management for sensitive data

## Contributing

We welcome contributions to improve and expand this automation and orchestration toolkit! If you have suggestions, bug reports, or want to add a new tool, please feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request.
