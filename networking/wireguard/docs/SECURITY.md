# Security Considerations for Wireguard Docker Setup

This document outlines important security considerations for your Wireguard VPN setup.

## General Security Practices

1. **Keep Software Updated**: Regularly update your Docker images and host system to patch known vulnerabilities.

2. **Use Strong Keys**: Wireguard generates strong keys by default. Avoid manually setting weak keys.

3. **Limit Access**: Only expose the necessary ports (default UDP 51820) to the internet.

4. **Use Firewalls**: Implement a firewall on your host system and only allow traffic on the Wireguard port.

5. **Monitor Logs**: Regularly review your Wireguard logs for any suspicious activity.

## Docker-specific Security

1. **Use Non-root User**: The provided setup runs Wireguard as a non-root user. Avoid changing this unless necessary.

2. **Limit Container Capabilities**: The setup only adds necessary capabilities (`NET_ADMIN`, `SYS_MODULE`). Don't add more unless required.

3. **Use Read-only Volumes**: When possible, mount volumes as read-only.

## Wireguard-specific Security

1. **Key Management**: Securely store and transmit client configuration files. These contain private keys.

2. **IP Filtering**: Use the `ALLOWED_IPS` setting to restrict which traffic goes through the VPN.

3. **DNS Settings**: Be cautious when setting custom DNS servers. Malicious DNS servers can redirect traffic.

4. **Peer Management**: Regularly audit and remove unused peer configurations.

## Network Security

1. **Separate Networks**: If possible, place your Wireguard server in a separate network or DMZ.

2. **Egress Filtering**: Implement egress filtering on your network to control outbound traffic from VPN clients.

3. **Rate Limiting**: Consider implementing rate limiting on your Wireguard port to prevent DoS attacks.

## Monitoring and Auditing

1. **Log Analysis**: Regularly analyze Wireguard logs for unusual patterns or failed connection attempts.

2. **Traffic Monitoring**: Monitor traffic patterns for any anomalies.

3. **Regular Audits**: Perform regular security audits of your Wireguard setup and the host system.

Remember, security is an ongoing process. Regularly review and update your security practices.
