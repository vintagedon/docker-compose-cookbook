## Network Security

1. **Firewall Configuration**:

   - Restrict access to Pi-hole ports (53, 80, 67) to your local network.
   - Use UFW or iptables to manage firewall rules.

2. **VPN Access**:

   - If accessing Pi-hole remotely, use a VPN for secure connections.

3. **VLAN Segmentation**:
   - Consider placing Pi-hole in a separate VLAN for enhanced security.

## Access Control

1. **Admin Interface**:

   - Use a strong, unique password for the web interface.
   - Change the default password immediately after setup.
   - Consider setting up 2FA for the admin interface.

2. **SSH Access**:
   - If enabling SSH, use key-based authentication.
   - Disable password authentication for SSH.

## DNS-over-HTTPS (DoH)

1. **Upstream DNS**:

   - Consider using DNS-over-HTTPS for upstream DNS queries.
   - Configure DoH in Pi-hole settings for enhanced privacy.

2. **Client-side DoH**:
   - Be aware that client-side DoH can bypass Pi-hole. Manage this at the client level.

## Regular Updates

1. **Pi-hole Updates**:

   - Regularly update Pi-hole to the latest version.
   - Use the `pihole -up` command or update the Docker image.

2. **Host System Updates**:
   - Keep the host system and Docker up-to-date with security patches.

## Monitoring and Logging

1. **Log Analysis**:

   - Regularly review Pi-hole logs for unusual activity.
   - Consider integrating with a SIEM system for advanced monitoring.

2. **Alerts**:
   - Set up alerts for abnormal DNS query patterns or high traffic volumes.

## DHCP Security

If using Pi-hole as a DHCP server:

1. **DHCP Snooping**:

   - Implement DHCP snooping on your network switches if possible.

2. **Static Leases**:
   - Use static DHCP leases for known devices to prevent unauthorized access.

## Custom Lists

1. **Blocklist Management**:

   - Regularly review and update your blocklists.
   - Be cautious when adding third-party blocklists, verify their reliability.

2. **Whitelist Review**:
   - Periodically review your whitelist to ensure it's up-to-date and necessary.

Remember, security is an ongoing process. Regularly review and update your security practices to keep your Pi-hole installation safe and effective.
