# OpenVPN Docker Setup

[![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-yellow.svg)](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT)

OpenVPN is an open-source virtual private network (VPN) system that implements techniques to create secure point-to-point or site-to-site connections in routed or bridged configurations. This Docker setup provides an easy way to deploy and manage an OpenVPN server.

## Prerequisites

- Docker
- Docker Compose
- Basic understanding of networking and VPNs

## Quick Start

1. Clone this repository
2. Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and adjust the variables as needed
3. Run `docker-compose up -d`
4. Use the provided scripts to generate client configurations

For detailed instructions, refer to the [Configuration](#configuration) section.

## Configuration

For detailed configuration options, please refer to the [CONFIGURATION.md](docs/CONFIGURATION.md) file.

## Usage

1. Start the OpenVPN server:
   ```
   docker-compose up -d
   ```
2. Generate a client configuration:
   ```
   docker-compose run --rm openvpn easyrsa build-client-full CLIENT_NAME nopass
   docker-compose run --rm openvpn ovpn_getclient CLIENT_NAME > CLIENT_NAME.ovpn
   ```
3. Distribute the `.ovpn` file to your client securely
4. Connect to the VPN using the generated `.ovpn` file

## Advanced Configuration

For advanced configuration options, including server settings and routing, please refer to the [CONFIGURATION.md](docs/CONFIGURATION.md) file.

## Data Persistence

OpenVPN configuration and certificates are stored in a Docker volume. Ensure to back up this volume regularly.

## Networking

By default, the OpenVPN server uses UDP port 1194. Ensure this port is open and forwarded to the Docker host if running behind a NAT.

## Security Considerations

For important security considerations and best practices, please refer to the [SECURITY.md](docs/SECURITY.md) file.

## Performance Tuning

For tips on optimizing OpenVPN performance, please refer to the [PERFORMANCE_TUNING.md](docs/PERFORMANCE_TUNING.md) file.

## Multi-Node Setup

For information on setting up OpenVPN in a multi-node environment, please refer to the [MULTI_NODE_SETUP.md](docs/MULTI_NODE_SETUP.md) file.

## Upgrading

For instructions on upgrading your OpenVPN Docker setup, please refer to the [UPGRADING.md](docs/UPGRADING.md) file.

## Troubleshooting

For common issues and their solutions, please refer to the [TROUBLESHOOTING.md](docs/TROUBLESHOOTING.md) file.
