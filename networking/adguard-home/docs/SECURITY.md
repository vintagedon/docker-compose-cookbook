# Security Considerations for AdGuard Home Docker Setup

This document outlines important security considerations and best practices for your AdGuard Home Docker setup.

## Network Security

1. Use a separate network for AdGuard Home:

   ```yaml
   networks:
     adguard_net:
       driver: bridge
   ```

2. Limit exposed ports:

   - Only expose necessary ports (53 for DNS, 3000 for web UI)
   - Use IP tables or firewall rules to restrict access

3. Use HTTPS for web interface:
   - Set up a reverse proxy with SSL/TLS (e.g., Nginx, Traefik)
   - Use Let's Encrypt for free SSL certificates

## Container Security

1. Run container as non-root user:

   ```yaml
   user: 1000:1000
   ```

2. Use read-only file system where possible:

   ```yaml
   read_only: true
   ```

3. Limit container capabilities:

   ```yaml
   cap_drop:
     - ALL
   cap_add:
     - NET_BIND_SERVICE
   ```

4. Enable Docker's security options:
   ```yaml
   security_opt:
     - no-new-privileges:true
   ```

## AdGuard Home Configuration

1. Use strong admin password
2. Enable DNSSEC for DNS security
3. Use DNS-over-HTTPS or DNS-over-TLS for upstream servers
4. Regularly update AdGuard Home to the latest version
5. Implement access controls for the web interface

## Data Protection

1. Use volume binding for persistent data:

   ```yaml
   volumes:
     - /path/on/host:/opt/adguardhome/work
     - /path/on/host:/opt/adguardhome/conf
   ```

2. Implement regular backups of configuration and data
3. Encrypt sensitive data at rest

## Monitoring and Logging

1. Enable query logging for security analysis
2. Use centralized logging system (e.g., ELK stack)
3. Implement intrusion detection/prevention systems

## Regular Security Audits

1. Perform regular security scans of your Docker host
2. Review and update security settings periodically
3. Stay informed about security updates and patches

Remember, security is an ongoing process. Regularly review and update your security measures to protect against new threats.
