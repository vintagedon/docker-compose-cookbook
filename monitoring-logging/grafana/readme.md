## Prerequisites

- Docker
- Docker Compose
- At least 1GB of free memory

## Quick Start

1. Clone this repository
2. Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and adjust the variables as needed
3. Run `docker-compose up -d`
4. Access Grafana at http://localhost:3000
5. Log in with the default credentials (admin/admin) and set a new password

## Configuration

Refer to the [CONFIGURATION.md](docs/CONFIGURATION.md) file for detailed information on how to configure your Grafana instance.

## Usage

After starting the Grafana container, you can:

1. Add data sources (e.g., Prometheus, InfluxDB, Elasticsearch)
2. Create dashboards to visualize your data
3. Set up alerts based on your metrics

For more detailed usage instructions, refer to the [official Grafana documentation](https://grafana.com/docs/).

## Advanced Configuration

For advanced configuration options, including setting up plugins, configuring SMTP for alerting, and more, see the [CONFIGURATION.md](docs/CONFIGURATION.md) file.

## Data Persistence

Grafana data is persisted using Docker volumes. You can find the volume configuration in the `docker-compose.yml` file.

## Networking

By default, Grafana is exposed on port 3000. You can modify this in the `docker-compose.yml` file if needed.

## Security Considerations

Refer to the [SECURITY.md](docs/SECURITY.md) file for important security considerations and best practices.

## Performance Tuning

For tips on optimizing Grafana's performance, see the [PERFORMANCE_TUNING.md](docs/PERFORMANCE_TUNING.md) file.

## Multi-Node Setup

If you need to set up Grafana in a multi-node environment, refer to the [MULTI_NODE_SETUP.md](docs/MULTI_NODE_SETUP.md) file for instructions.

## Upgrading

For information on upgrading your Grafana instance, see the [UPGRADING.md](docs/UPGRADING.md) file.

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues, check the [TROUBLESHOOTING.md](docs/TROUBLESHOOTING.md) file for common problems and their solutions.
