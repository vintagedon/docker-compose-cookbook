## Authentication

1. Change the default admin password immediately after installation.
2. Use strong, unique passwords for all accounts.
3. Consider implementing multi-factor authentication (MFA) for added security.
4. If using LDAP or OAuth, ensure proper configuration and use HTTPS.

## Authorization

1. Use Grafana's built-in role-based access control (RBAC) to limit user permissions.
2. Follow the principle of least privilege when assigning roles.
3. Regularly audit user access and remove unnecessary permissions.

## Network Security

1. Use HTTPS to encrypt all traffic to and from Grafana.
2. Consider using a reverse proxy (e.g., Nginx) in front of Grafana for additional security.
3. Limit access to Grafana by IP address if possible.
4. Use Web Application Firewall (WAF) rules to protect against common web attacks.

## Data Source Security

1. Use separate accounts with minimal necessary permissions for each data source.
2. Store data source credentials securely, preferably using a secret management system.
3. Use SSL/TLS for connections to data sources whenever possible.

## Plugin Security

1. Only install plugins from trusted sources.
2. Regularly update plugins to their latest versions.
3. Be cautious when using unsigned plugins, as they may pose security risks.

## Encryption

1. Use Grafana's built-in encryption for sensitive information in the database.
2. Ensure that the `secret_key` in Grafana's configuration is strong and kept secret.

## Updating

1. Regularly update Grafana to the latest stable version to ensure you have the latest security patches.
2. Subscribe to Grafana's security mailing list to stay informed about vulnerabilities and updates.

## Monitoring and Logging

1. Enable detailed logging and regularly review logs for suspicious activity.
2. Consider using a Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) system to aggregate and analyze logs.
3. Set up alerts for unusual activity, such as multiple failed login attempts.

Remember, security is an ongoing process. Regularly review and update your security measures to protect against new threats and vulnerabilities.
