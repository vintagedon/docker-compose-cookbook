## Hardware Considerations

1. Ensure sufficient CPU and RAM for your expected load.
2. Use SSDs for better I/O performance, especially for the database.

## Database Optimization

1. Use PostgreSQL instead of SQLite for better performance in production environments.
2. Regularly vacuum and analyze your PostgreSQL database to optimize query planning.
3. Consider using connection pooling (e.g., pgBouncer) for high-load scenarios.

## Query Performance

1. Optimize your data source queries:
   - Use appropriate time ranges and intervals.
   - Avoid querying unnecessary metrics.
2. Use query caching where possible.
3. Consider using query splitting for large time ranges.

## Dashboard Optimization

1. Limit the number of panels per dashboard.
2. Use appropriate time ranges and refresh intervals.
3. Avoid using many high-cardinality variables.
4. Use template variables to make dashboards more efficient and reusable.

## Caching

1. Enable and configure Grafana's built-in caching:

```ini
[caching]
enabled = true
```

2. For high-load environments, consider using Redis for caching:

```ini
[caching]
enabled = true
type = redis
```

## Rendering

1. For installations with many users or complex dashboards, consider using the Grafana Image Renderer plugin.
2. Set up a separate rendering service to offload rendering work from the main Grafana instance.

## Container Resource Allocation

1. Allocate appropriate CPU and memory resources to your Grafana container:

```yaml
services:
  grafana:
    # ...
    deploy:
      resources:
        limits:
          cpus: "1"
          memory: 1G
        reservations:
          cpus: "0.5"
          memory: 512M
```

2. Monitor container resource usage and adjust as necessary.

Remember, performance tuning is an iterative process. Regularly monitor your Grafana instance's performance and make adjustments as needed based on your specific use case and load.
