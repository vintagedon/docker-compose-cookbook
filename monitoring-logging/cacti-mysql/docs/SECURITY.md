## Network Security

1. Use a firewall to restrict access to Cacti and MySQL ports
2. Implement VPN for remote access
3. Use SSL/TLS for web interface access (configure in your reverse proxy)
4. Segregate monitoring traffic using VLANs where possible

## Access Control

1. Use strong, unique passwords for all accounts
2. Implement multi-factor authentication for Cacti web interface
3. Regularly review and audit user accounts and permissions
4. Use the principle of least privilege for all accounts

## Data Protection

1. Encrypt sensitive data at rest (e.g., use encrypted volumes for MySQL data)
2. Implement regular backups and test restoration processes
3. Secure backup storage and transmission
4. Implement data retention policies in compliance with relevant regulations

## Update Management

1. Regularly update Cacti, MySQL, and all system components
2. Subscribe to security mailing lists for used components
3. Implement a patch management process
4. Test updates in a non-production environment before applying to production

## Monitoring and Auditing

1. Enable and monitor Cacti and MySQL logs
2. Implement centralized logging for easier analysis
3. Set up alerts for suspicious activities
4. Regularly review logs and investigate anomalies

## SNMP Security

1. Use SNMPv3 with authentication and encryption where possible
2. If using SNMPv2c, use strong community strings and restrict access
3. Regularly rotate SNMP community strings
4. Use separate read-only and read-write community strings

Remember, security is an ongoing process. Regularly review and update your security measures, and stay informed about new security threats and best practices in the monitoring and logging domain.
