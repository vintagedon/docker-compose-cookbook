## Access Control

### User Authentication

- Use strong, unique passwords for all accounts.
- Implement multi-factor authentication (MFA) for admin accounts.
- Consider integrating with LDAP or Active Directory for centralized user management.

### Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)

- Create and assign roles based on the principle of least privilege.
- Regularly audit user permissions and remove unnecessary access.

## Network Security

### Firewall Configuration

- Restrict inbound traffic to only necessary ports (e.g., 9000 for web interface, 12201 for GELF).
- Use security groups or iptables to control access between containers.

### TLS/SSL

- Enable HTTPS for the web interface and API.
- Use valid SSL certificates from a trusted Certificate Authority.
- Configure TLS for communication between Graylog and Elasticsearch.

Example Graylog HTTPS configuration:

```yaml
environment:
  GRAYLOG_HTTP_EXTERNAL_URI: "https://graylog.example.com/"
  GRAYLOG_HTTP_TLS_CERT_FILE: "/path/to/certfile.crt"
  GRAYLOG_HTTP_TLS_KEY_FILE: "/path/to/keyfile.key"
```

## Data Encryption

### Encryption at Rest

- Enable encryption for Elasticsearch indices.
- Use encrypted volumes for Docker containers.

### Encryption in Transit

- Use TLS for all communication between components.
- Encrypt sensitive data before sending it to Graylog (e.g., using GELF over TLS).

## Secure Configuration

### Environment Variables

- Do not store sensitive information in environment variables directly in the `docker-compose.yml` file.
- Use Docker secrets or a secure key management system.

### File Permissions

- Ensure proper file permissions for configuration files and certificates.
- Run containers with non-root users when possible.

## Monitoring and Auditing

### Logging

- Enable audit logging in Graylog to track user actions.
- Centralize logs from all components (Graylog, Elasticsearch, MongoDB) for analysis.

### Intrusion Detection

- Implement network-based and host-based intrusion detection systems.
- Set up alerts for suspicious activities.

## Regular Updates

- Keep all components (Graylog, Elasticsearch, MongoDB) up to date with the latest security patches.
- Regularly update the base Docker images used in your setup.

## Backup and Recovery

- Implement regular backups of Graylog data, Elasticsearch indices, and MongoDB databases.
- Test your backup and recovery process periodically.

Remember, security is an ongoing process. Regularly review and update your security measures to address new threats and vulnerabilities.
