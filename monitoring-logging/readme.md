## 📁 General Structure

Each tool setup in this section typically follows this structure:

```
tool-name/
├── docker-compose.yml
├── .env.example
├── README.md
└── config/
    └── (tool-specific configuration files)
```

## 🚀 Usage

To use any of the monitoring and logging setups in this section:

1. Navigate to the desired tool's directory
2. Copy the `.env.example` file to `.env` and configure as needed
3. Run the Docker Compose command

For example, to set up Grafana:

```bash
cd grafana
cp .env.example .env
nano .env  # Edit settings as needed
docker-compose up -d
```

Refer to each tool's README for specific instructions, configuration details, and access information.

## 🔒 Security Considerations

When working with monitoring and logging tools, keep these security practices in mind:

- Use strong, unique passwords for all services
- Implement proper firewall rules and network segmentation
- Regularly update Docker images and host systems
- Use HTTPS for web interfaces and encrypt communication between services
- Implement proper access controls and user management
- Be cautious about sensitive data in logs and metrics
- Regularly rotate log files and implement log retention policies
- Monitor access to monitoring and logging tools
- Implement alerting for suspicious activities or system anomalies
- Ensure proper data encryption for stored logs and metrics
