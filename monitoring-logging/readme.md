## Available Setups

| Tool | Description | Repo Link |
|------|-------------|-----------|
| Prometheus | An open-source monitoring and alerting toolkit | [Prometheus](https://github.com/vintagedon/docker-compose-cookbook/tree/main/monitoring-logging/Prometheus) |
| Cacti MySQL | A complete network graphing solution using MySQL | [Cacti MySQL](https://github.com/vintagedon/docker-compose-cookbook/tree/main/monitoring-logging/cacti-mysql) |
| Fluentd | An open-source data collector for unified logging layer | [Fluentd](https://github.com/vintagedon/docker-compose-cookbook/tree/main/monitoring-logging/fluentd) |
| Grafana | An open-source platform for monitoring and observability | [Grafana](https://github.com/vintagedon/docker-compose-cookbook/tree/main/monitoring-logging/grafana) |
| Graylog-Elasticsearch-MongoDB | A log management platform using Elasticsearch and MongoDB | [Graylog](https://github.com/vintagedon/docker-compose-cookbook/tree/main/monitoring-logging/graylog-elasticsearch-mongodb) |

## General Structure

Each subdirectory typically contains the following files:

- `docker-compose.yml`: Defines the services, networks, and volumes for the setup.
- `.env`: Contains environment variables used in the docker-compose file.
- `README.md`: Provides specific instructions and details for the particular setup.
- Additional configuration files as needed for each tool.

## Usage

To use any of these setups, follow these general steps:

1. Navigate to the desired subdirectory.
2. Review the `README.md` file for any specific instructions.
3. Modify the `.env` file if necessary.
4. Run the following command to start the services:

   ```
   docker-compose up -d
   ```

For example, to set up Grafana:

```bash
cd grafana
docker-compose up -d
```

This will start Grafana in detached mode. Access the Grafana interface by navigating to `http://localhost:3000` in your web browser (unless you've changed the port in the configuration).

## Security Considerations

When working with monitoring and logging tools, keep these security practices in mind:

- Always change default passwords for any services.
- Use secure, encrypted connections where possible.
- Regularly update your Docker images to the latest versions.
- Limit access to your monitoring and logging interfaces.
- Be cautious about what data you collect and store.
