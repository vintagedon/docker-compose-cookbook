# Fluentd Docker Setup

[![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-yellow.svg)](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT)

Fluentd is an open-source data collector for unified logging layer. It allows you to unify data collection and consumption for better use and understanding of data. This Docker setup is specifically configured for use with Cacti and MySQL, providing a robust logging solution for your monitoring environment.

## Prerequisites

- Docker
- Docker Compose
- Basic understanding of logging concepts and Fluentd

## Quick Start

1. Clone this repository
2. Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and adjust the variables as needed
3. Run `docker-compose up -d`
4. Fluentd will start collecting logs from Cacti and MySQL

## Configuration

Detailed configuration instructions can be found in [CONFIGURATION.md](docs/CONFIGURATION.md). This includes setting up Fluentd to collect logs from Cacti and MySQL, as well as configuring output plugins for your preferred log destinations.

## Usage

Once Fluentd is up and running, it will automatically collect logs from Cacti and MySQL based on the configuration. You can view the collected logs using your configured output destinations (e.g., Elasticsearch, S3, etc.).

## Advanced Configuration

For more advanced setups, including custom plugins and complex log routing, refer to [CONFIGURATION.md](docs/CONFIGURATION.md).

## Data Persistence

Fluentd logs and configuration are persisted using Docker volumes. Ensure regular backups of these volumes to prevent data loss.

## Networking

By default, Fluentd is configured to run on the same network as Cacti and MySQL. Ensure that the necessary ports are exposed and that Fluentd can access the log files it needs to collect.

## Security Considerations

Refer to [SECURITY.md](docs/SECURITY.md) for important security considerations, including securing log data, network security, and access control.

## Performance Tuning

For guidance on optimizing Fluentd performance, especially for high-volume logging environments, see [PERFORMANCE_TUNING.md](docs/PERFORMANCE_TUNING.md).

## Multi-Node Setup

Instructions for setting up Fluentd in a distributed environment can be found in [MULTI_NODE_SETUP.md](docs/MULTI_NODE_SETUP.md).

## Upgrading

For instructions on upgrading Fluentd or this Docker setup, refer to [UPGRADING.md](docs/UPGRADING.md).

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues, check [TROUBLESHOOTING.md](docs/TROUBLESHOOTING.md) for common problems and their solutions.
