## Checking Current Version

1. Check the current Fluentd version:
   ```
   docker exec fluentd fluentd --version
   ```
2. Note the version in your docker-compose.yml file.

## Preparing for Upgrade

1. **Backup your configuration:**

   ```
   cp docker-compose.yml docker-compose.yml.backup
   cp scripts/init.conf scripts/init.conf.backup
   ```

2. **Review the changelog** for the new version you're upgrading to.

3. **Check plugin compatibility** with the new Fluentd version.

4. **Plan for downtime** or implement a zero-downtime upgrade strategy.

## Upgrade Process

1. Update the Fluentd version in your docker-compose.yml file:

   ```yaml
   fluentd:
     image: fluent/fluentd:v1.x.x # Replace with the new version
   ```

2. Pull the new image:

   ```
   docker-compose pull
   ```

3. Restart the Fluentd container:

   ```
   docker-compose up -d
   ```

4. Verify the new version:
   ```
   docker exec fluentd fluentd --version
   ```

## Post-Upgrade Steps

1. **Check logs** for any errors or warnings:

   ```
   docker logs fluentd
   ```

2. **Verify log collection** is working as expected.

3. **Test all integrations** to ensure compatibility.

4. **Monitor performance** to catch any regressions.

## Rollback Procedure

If issues are encountered:

1. Stop the container:

   ```
   docker-compose down
   ```

2. Restore the backup configuration:

   ```
   cp docker-compose.yml.backup docker-compose.yml
   cp scripts/init.conf.backup scripts/init.conf
   ```

3. Start the container with the old version:
   ```
   docker-compose up -d
   ```

## Upgrading Plugins

1. List current plugins:

   ```
   docker exec fluentd fluent-gem list
   ```

2. Update plugins in your Dockerfile or docker-compose.yml:

   ```dockerfile
   RUN fluent-gem install fluent-plugin-elasticsearch -v 5.0.3
   ```

3. Rebuild your custom image if using a Dockerfile:

   ```
   docker-compose build
   ```

4. Restart the Fluentd container:
   ```
   docker-compose up -d
   ```

## Compatibility Notes

- Always check the [Fluentd changelog](https://github.com/fluent/fluentd/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md) for breaking changes.
- Some configuration parameters may be deprecated or changed between major versions.
- Plugin APIs may change, requiring updates to custom plugins.

Remember to test the upgrade process in a non-production environment before applying it to your production setup.
