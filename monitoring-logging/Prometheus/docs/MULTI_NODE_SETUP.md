## Introduction

While a single Prometheus server can handle many scenarios, there are cases where a multi-node setup is beneficial or necessary. This could be for high availability, improved performance, or to handle larger-scale monitoring needs.

## Prometheus Federation

Prometheus supports a hierarchical federation model, allowing one Prometheus server to scrape selected time series from another Prometheus server.

To set up federation, add a scrape config to the upper-level Prometheus:

```yaml
scrape_configs:
  - job_name: "federate"
    scrape_interval: 15s
    honor_labels: true
    metrics_path: "/federate"
    params:
      "match[]":
        - '{job="prometheus"}'
        - '{__name__=~"job:.*"}'
    static_configs:
      - targets:
          - "prometheus-1:9090"
          - "prometheus-2:9090"
```

## High Availability Setup

For high availability, you can run multiple identical Prometheus servers and put them behind a load balancer.

1. Set up multiple Prometheus instances, each with the same configuration.
2. Use a service discovery mechanism to dynamically update the list of targets.
3. Use a load balancer to distribute queries across the Prometheus instances.

## Load Balancing

You can use various load balancing solutions such as:

- Hardware load balancers
- Software load balancers (e.g., HAProxy, NGINX)
- Cloud-based load balancers (e.g., AWS ELB, Google Cloud Load Balancing)

Example HAProxy configuration:

```
frontend prometheus
    bind *:9090
    default_backend prometheus_backends

backend prometheus_backends
    balance roundrobin
    server prometheus1 prometheus1:9090 check
    server prometheus2 prometheus2:9090 check
```

## Data Consistency

In a multi-node setup, it's important to ensure data consistency across Prometheus instances. Consider the following:

1. Use the same scrape configurations across all Prometheus instances.
2. Implement consistent alerting rules across instances.
3. Use remote storage solutions for long-term storage and consistency.

## Scaling Considerations

When scaling Prometheus:

1. Vertical Scaling: Increase resources (CPU, RAM) for Prometheus instances.
2. Horizontal Scaling: Add more Prometheus instances and use federation.
3. Optimize scrape intervals and retention periods.
4. Use remote storage for long-term data retention.
5. Consider using Thanos or Cortex for large-scale deployments.

Remember, multi-node setups introduce complexity. Ensure you have proper monitoring, alerting, and management processes in place for the Prometheus instances themselves.
