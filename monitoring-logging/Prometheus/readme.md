# Prometheus Docker Setup

[![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-yellow.svg)](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT)

Prometheus is an open-source systems monitoring and alerting toolkit. It collects and stores its metrics as time series data, i.e. metrics information is stored with the timestamp at which it was recorded, alongside optional key-value pairs called labels.

## Prerequisites

- Docker
- Docker Compose
- Basic understanding of monitoring concepts

## Quick Start

1. Clone this repository
2. Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and adjust the variables as needed
3. Run `docker-compose up -d`
4. Access Prometheus web interface at http://localhost:9090

## Configuration

Prometheus is configured via a YAML file. The main configuration file is located at `scripts/prometheus.yml`. You can modify this file to add or remove targets, change scrape intervals, or configure other Prometheus settings.

For detailed configuration options, please refer to the [official Prometheus documentation](https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/configuration/configuration/).

## Usage

After starting the Prometheus container, you can:

1. Access the Prometheus web interface at http://localhost:9090
2. Use the PromQL language to query metrics
3. Set up alerts based on metric thresholds
4. Integrate with visualization tools like Grafana for better data representation

For more information on using Prometheus, check the [official documentation](https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/getting_started/).

## Advanced Configuration

For advanced configuration options, including setting up alerting rules, configuring remote storage, and integrating with other systems, please refer to the `docs/CONFIGURATION.md` file.

## Data Persistence

Prometheus data is persisted in a Docker volume. This ensures that your metrics data survives container restarts. The volume is defined in the `docker-compose.yml` file.

## Networking

By default, Prometheus exposes its web interface on port 9090. You can change this in the `docker-compose.yml` file if needed. Make sure to update your firewall rules accordingly if you're running this setup in a production environment.

## Security Considerations

Please refer to the `docs/SECURITY.md` file for important security considerations when running Prometheus in a Docker container, including:

- Access control
- Encryption in transit
- Secure scraping endpoints

## Performance Tuning

For information on optimizing Prometheus performance, including storage tuning, query optimization, and resource allocation, please see the `docs/PERFORMANCE_TUNING.md` file.

## Multi-Node Setup

For instructions on setting up Prometheus in a multi-node environment, including high availability configurations, please refer to the `docs/MULTI_NODE_SETUP.md` file.

## Upgrading

For guidelines on upgrading Prometheus to newer versions, please see the `docs/UPGRADING.md` file.

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues, please check the `docs/TROUBLESHOOTING.md` file for common problems and their solutions.

## Contributing

We welcome contributions! Please see the `docs/CONTRIBUTING.md` file for details on how to contribute to this project.
