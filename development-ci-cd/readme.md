## Available Setups

| Application | Description | Repository Link |
|-------------|-------------|-----------------|
| Gitea (MySQL) | A lightweight, self-hosted Git service with MySQL backend | [gitea-mysql](./gitea-mysql) |
| Gitea (PostgreSQL) | A lightweight, self-hosted Git service with PostgreSQL backend | [gitea-postgresql](./gitea-postgresql) |
| Gitea (SQLite) | A lightweight, self-hosted Git service with SQLite backend | [gitea-sqlite](./gitea-sqlite) |
| GitLab CE | A complete DevOps platform with Git repository management, CI/CD, monitoring, and more | [gitlabce](./gitlabce) |
| Gogs (MySQL) | A simple, lightweight, and self-hosted Git service with MySQL backend | [gogs-mysql](./gogs-mysql) |
| Gogs (PostgreSQL) | A simple, lightweight, and self-hosted Git service with PostgreSQL backend | [gogs-postgresql](./gogs-postgresql) |
| Gogs (SQLite) | A simple, lightweight, and self-hosted Git service with SQLite backend | [gogs-sqlite](./gogs-sqlite) |
| Jenkins | An open-source automation server for building, deploying, and automating any project | [jenkins](./jenkins) |

## General Structure

Each application setup in this section follows a consistent structure:

```
application-name/
├── docker-compose.yml
├── .env
└── README.md
```

- `docker-compose.yml`: Defines the services, networks, and volumes for the application.
- `.env`: Contains environment variables for customizing the setup.
- `README.md`: Provides specific instructions, configuration options, and other relevant information for the application.

Additional files or directories may be present depending on the specific requirements of each application.

## Usage

To use any of these setups:

1. Navigate to the desired application's directory.
2. Review the README.md file for specific instructions and configuration options.
3. Adjust the `.env` file (if present) to customize the setup.
4. Run `docker-compose up -d` to start the application.

For example, to set up Gitea with PostgreSQL:

```bash
cd gitea-postgresql
cat README.md
nano .env  # Make any necessary changes
docker-compose up -d
```

## Security Considerations

When deploying these Development & CI/CD tools, consider the following security best practices:

1. **Access Control**: Use strong passwords and enable two-factor authentication where available.
2. **Network Security**: Run tools on isolated networks and use VPNs for remote access.
3. **Updates**: Keep Docker images and applications up-to-date with the latest security patches.
4. **Encryption**: Enable HTTPS and encrypt data at rest where possible.
5. **Secrets Management**: Use Docker secrets or dedicated tools to manage sensitive information.
6. **Logging and Monitoring**: Enable and regularly review logs; set up alerts for suspicious activities.
7. **Least Privilege**: Grant minimum necessary permissions, especially in CI/CD pipelines.
8. **Backups**: Regularly backup data and test recovery processes.

Always refer to each tool's official documentation for specific security guidelines.
