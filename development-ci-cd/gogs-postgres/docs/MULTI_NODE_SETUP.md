## Overview

A multi-node setup for Gogs allows for improved performance, high availability, and better scalability. This setup typically involves multiple Gogs instances, a load balancer, and a PostgreSQL cluster.

## Architecture

A basic multi-node architecture for Gogs might look like this:

```
[Client] -> [Load Balancer] -> [Gogs Instance 1]
                            -> [Gogs Instance 2]
                            -> [Gogs Instance N]
                               |
                               v
                            [PostgreSQL Primary]
                               |
                               v
                            [PostgreSQL Replica 1]
                            [PostgreSQL Replica N]
```

## Load Balancer Setup

1. Choose a load balancer (e.g., Nginx, HAProxy, or cloud-provided solutions like AWS ELB)
2. Configure health checks for Gogs instances
3. Set up SSL termination at the load balancer (recommended)

Example Nginx configuration:

```nginx
upstream gogs_servers {
    server gogs1:3000;
    server gogs2:3000;
    server gogs3:3000;
}

server {
    listen 80;
    server_name git.example.com;

    location / {
        proxy_pass http://gogs_servers;
        proxy_set_header Host $host;
        proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
    }
}
```

## Gogs Instance Configuration

1. Use the same `app.ini` configuration across all instances
2. Ensure `RUN_MODE = prod` is set
3. Configure a shared storage solution for Git repositories
4. Use the same database configuration pointing to the PostgreSQL cluster

Example `docker-compose.yml` for one Gogs instance:

```yaml
version: "3"
services:
  gogs:
    image: gogs/gogs
    volumes:
      - /shared/gogs-repos:/data/git/gogs-repositories
      - /shared/gogs-config:/data/gogs/conf
    environment:
      - PGHOST=postgres-primary.example.com
      - PGDATABASE=gogs
      - PGUSER=gogs
      - PGPASSWORD=your_password
```

## PostgreSQL Replication

Set up PostgreSQL with primary-replica replication:

1. Configure the primary server for replication
2. Set up one or more replica servers
3. Use a tool like PgPool-II or Patroni for automatic failover

Example `postgresql.conf` for the primary:

```
wal_level = replica
max_wal_senders = 10
wal_keep_segments = 32
```

## Shared Storage

Use a shared storage solution for Git repositories to ensure consistency across Gogs instances:

1. NFS (Network File System)
2. GlusterFS
3. Cloud-based solutions (e.g., AWS EFS, Azure Files)

## Monitoring and Logging

Implement a monitoring and logging solution:

1. Use Prometheus and Grafana for monitoring
2. Set up centralized logging with the ELK stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana) or a cloud-based solution

## Backup and Recovery

Implement a robust backup strategy:

1. Regular PostgreSQL backups (e.g., pg_dump)
2. Git repository backups
3. Configuration backups
4. Test recovery procedures regularly

For detailed implementation steps and best practices, consult with a DevOps professional and refer to the official documentation for each component in your stack.
