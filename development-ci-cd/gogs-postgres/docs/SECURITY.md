## Network Security

1. Use Docker's internal network for communication between Gogs and PostgreSQL.
2. Expose only necessary ports to the host.
3. Implement a reverse proxy (e.g., Nginx) for SSL termination and additional security layers.
4. Use UFW or iptables to restrict incoming traffic.

Example `docker-compose.yml` network configuration:

```yaml
services:
  gogs:
    networks:
      - internal
  postgres:
    networks:
      - internal

networks:
  internal:
    driver: bridge
```

## Authentication and Authorization

1. Enforce strong password policies.
2. Implement two-factor authentication (2FA).
3. Use LDAP or OAuth for centralized authentication if applicable.
4. Regularly audit user accounts and permissions.

Configure in `app.ini`:

```ini
[security]
INSTALL_LOCK = true
MIN_PASSWORD_LENGTH = 12
DISABLE_GIT_HOOKS = true

[service]
REQUIRE_SIGNIN_VIEW = true
ENABLE_NOTIFY_MAIL = true

[auth]
REQUIRE_EMAIL_CONFIRMATION = true
DISABLE_REGISTRATION = false
ENABLE_REGISTRATION_CAPTCHA = true
```

## Database Security

1. Use strong, unique passwords for database users.
2. Restrict database user permissions to only what's necessary.
3. Enable SSL for database connections.
4. Regularly update the PostgreSQL server.

Example PostgreSQL security settings:

```sql
ALTER USER gogs WITH PASSWORD 'strong_random_password';
REVOKE ALL ON SCHEMA public FROM PUBLIC;
GRANT USAGE ON SCHEMA public TO gogs;
```

## Docker Security

1. Run containers as non-root users.
2. Use read-only file systems where possible.
3. Limit container resources.
4. Regularly update base images.

Example `docker-compose.yml` security settings:

```yaml
services:
  gogs:
    user: "1000:1000"
    read_only: true
    tmpfs:
      - /tmp
    security_opt:
      - no-new-privileges:true
```

## SSL/TLS Configuration

1. Use Let's Encrypt for free, automated SSL certificates.
2. Configure Gogs to use HTTPS.
3. Implement HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS).

Example Nginx configuration for SSL:

```nginx
server {
    listen 443 ssl http2;
    server_name git.example.com;

    ssl_certificate /etc/letsencrypt/live/git.example.com/fullchain.pem;
    ssl_certificate_key /etc/letsencrypt/live/git.example.com/privkey.pem;

    ssl_protocols TLSv1.2 TLSv1.3;
    ssl_prefer_server_ciphers on;
    ssl_ciphers ECDHE-ECDSA-AES128-GCM-SHA256:ECDHE-RSA-AES128-GCM-SHA256:ECDHE-ECDSA-AES256-GCM-SHA384:ECDHE-RSA-AES256-GCM-SHA384:ECDHE-ECDSA-CHACHA20-POLY1305:ECDHE-RSA-CHACHA20-POLY1305:DHE-RSA-AES128-GCM-SHA256:DHE-RSA-AES256-GCM-SHA384;

    add_header Strict-Transport-Security "max-age=31536000; includeSubDomains" always;
}
```

## Regular Updates

1. Subscribe to security mailing lists for Gogs, PostgreSQL, and Docker.
2. Implement a process for regular updates and patches.
3. Test updates in a staging environment before applying to production.

## Monitoring and Logging

1. Implement centralized logging (e.g., ELK stack).
2. Set up alerts for suspicious activities.
3. Regularly review logs for security events.

Example logging configuration in `app.ini`:

```ini
[log]
MODE = file
LEVEL = Info
ROOT_PATH = /data/gogs/log
```

## Backup and Recovery

1. Implement regular, automated backups of both Gogs data and PostgreSQL database.
2. Store backups securely, preferably off-site.
3. Regularly test the restore process to ensure data integrity.

Example backup script:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
TIMESTAMP=$(date +"%Y%m%d_%H%M%S")
docker exec gogs-postgres pg_dump -U gogs gogs > gogs_db_backup_$TIMESTAMP.sql
docker exec gogs tar czf - /data/gogs > gogs_data_backup_$TIMESTAMP.tar.gz
```

Remember, security is an ongoing process. Regularly review and update your security measures to protect against new threats and vulnerabilities.
