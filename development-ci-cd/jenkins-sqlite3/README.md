## Prerequisites

- Docker
- Docker Compose
- At least 2GB of free memory

## Quick Start

1. Clone this repository
2. Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and adjust the variables as needed
3. Run `docker-compose up -d`
4. Access Jenkins at http://localhost:8080
5. Follow the initial setup wizard to complete the Jenkins installation

## Configuration

See [CONFIGURATION.md](docs/CONFIGURATION.md) for detailed information on configuring Jenkins and SQLite3.

## Usage

Once Jenkins is up and running, you can:

1. Create and manage Jenkins jobs
2. Set up continuous integration and delivery pipelines
3. Integrate with version control systems
4. Manage plugins and extensions

For more detailed usage instructions, refer to the [official Jenkins documentation](https://www.jenkins.io/doc/).

## Advanced Configuration

For advanced configuration options, including security settings, performance tuning, and multi-node setup, please refer to the following documents:

- [Security Considerations](docs/SECURITY.md)
- [Performance Tuning](docs/PERFORMANCE_TUNING.md)
- [Multi-Node Setup](docs/MULTI_NODE_SETUP.md)

## Data Persistence

Jenkins data and SQLite3 databases are persisted using Docker volumes. This ensures that your data remains intact even if the containers are stopped or removed.

## Networking

The Jenkins container exposes port 8080 for web access and port 50000 for agent connections. Adjust these in the `docker-compose.yml` file if needed.

## Security Considerations

Refer to [SECURITY.md](docs/SECURITY.md) for important security considerations and best practices.

## Performance Tuning

For tips on optimizing Jenkins performance, see [PERFORMANCE_TUNING.md](docs/PERFORMANCE_TUNING.md).

## Multi-Node Setup

Instructions for setting up a Jenkins cluster can be found in [MULTI_NODE_SETUP.md](docs/MULTI_NODE_SETUP.md).

## Upgrading

For information on upgrading Jenkins and SQLite3, see [UPGRADING.md](docs/UPGRADING.md).

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues, check [TROUBLESHOOTING.md](docs/TROUBLESHOOTING.md) for common problems and solutions.
