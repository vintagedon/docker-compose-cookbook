## Java Virtual Machine (JVM) Tuning

1. Adjust heap size:

   - Set initial and maximum heap size in `JAVA_OPTS` environment variable.
   - Example: `-Xms2g -Xmx4g`

2. Garbage Collection:

   - Use G1GC for better performance: `-XX:+UseG1GC`
   - Tune GC parameters: `-XX:MaxGCPauseMillis=200`

3. Enable compressed ordinary object pointers:
   - Add `-XX:+UseCompressedOops` to `JAVA_OPTS`

## Jenkins Configuration

1. Optimize executors:

   - Set the number of executors based on your server's CPU cores and available memory.

2. Job configurations:

   - Use Pipeline jobs for better performance and scalability.
   - Implement proper cleanup strategies for workspaces and builds.

3. Plugin management:

   - Regularly update plugins.
   - Remove unused plugins to reduce memory footprint.

4. Build throttling:
   - Use the "Throttle Concurrent Builds" plugin to manage resource usage.

## SQLite3 Optimization

1. Regular VACUUM:

   - Run `VACUUM` command periodically to optimize the database file size.

2. Indexing:

   - Create appropriate indexes for frequently queried columns.

3. Journal mode:

   - Use WAL (Write-Ahead Logging) mode for better concurrency:
     ```sql
     PRAGMA journal_mode=WAL;
     ```

4. Cache size:
   - Increase cache size for better performance:
     ```sql
     PRAGMA cache_size = -20000; -- Set cache size to 20MB
     ```

## Docker Container Optimization

1. Resource limits:

   - Set appropriate CPU and memory limits in `docker-compose.yml`.

2. Storage driver:

   - Use overlay2 storage driver for better performance.

3. Volumes:
   - Use named volumes for better I/O performance.

## Network Optimization

1. Reduce network latency:

   - Place Jenkins and build agents in the same network or data center.

2. Use HTTP/2:
   - Enable HTTP/2 in Jenkins for faster web UI loading.

## Monitoring and Profiling

1. Use monitoring plugins:

   - Install and configure the "Metrics" plugin for Jenkins.

2. JVM profiling:

   - Use tools like VisualVM or JProfiler for in-depth JVM analysis.

3. Docker monitoring:
   - Use Docker's built-in stats command or tools like cAdvisor for container monitoring.

Remember to test performance changes in a staging environment before applying them to production. Regularly monitor and adjust your settings as your Jenkins usage evolves.
