## General Security Practices

1. Keep all software up to date, including Docker, Gitea, and PostgreSQL.
2. Use strong, unique passwords for all accounts.
3. Implement proper access controls and follow the principle of least privilege.
4. Regularly audit your system for any security issues or misconfigurations.

## Docker Security

1. Use official Docker images from trusted sources.
2. Keep your Docker engine and Docker Compose up to date.
3. Don't run containers as root unless absolutely necessary.
4. Use Docker secrets for sensitive information instead of environment variables when possible.
5. Limit container capabilities and resources.

## Gitea Security

1. Enable HTTPS for secure communication. You can do this by setting up a reverse proxy with SSL/TLS termination.
2. Configure Gitea to use secure cookies by setting `GITEA__security__COOKIE_SECURE=true` in your environment.
3. Enable two-factor authentication for user accounts.
4. Regularly review and update Gitea's built-in security settings.
5. Use SSH keys for Git operations instead of passwords when possible.

## PostgreSQL Security

1. Use strong, unique passwords for the PostgreSQL user.
2. Limit network access to the PostgreSQL container. In this setup, it should only be accessible by the Gitea container.
3. Regularly backup your PostgreSQL data.
4. Enable SSL for PostgreSQL connections if extra security is required.

## Network Security

1. Use a reverse proxy (like Nginx or Traefik) to handle SSL/TLS termination and to add an extra layer of security.
2. Implement proper firewall rules to restrict access to your Gitea instance.
3. Consider using a VPN for remote access to your Gitea instance.

## Data Protection

1. Regularly backup both Gitea and PostgreSQL data.
2. Encrypt sensitive data at rest and in transit.
3. Implement proper access controls for your data volumes.
4. Consider using Docker volumes with encryption for storing sensitive data.

## Monitoring and Logging

1. Implement logging for both Gitea and PostgreSQL.
2. Regularly review logs for any suspicious activity.
3. Consider using a centralized logging solution for easier monitoring and analysis.
4. Set up alerts for any unusual activity or system issues.

## Regular Updates

1. Regularly check for and apply updates to Gitea, PostgreSQL, and any other software used in your setup.
2. Have a tested process for applying updates to minimize downtime and ensure smooth upgrades.
3. Keep track of security advisories for all components of your stack.

Remember, security is an ongoing process. Regularly review and update your security measures to protect against new threats and vulnerabilities.
