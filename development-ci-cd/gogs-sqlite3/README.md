## Prerequisites

- Docker
- Docker Compose
- At least 1GB of free memory

## Quick Start

1. Clone this repository
2. Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and adjust the variables as needed
3. Run `docker-compose up -d`
4. Access Gogs at http://localhost:3000
5. Follow the installation wizard to set up your Gogs instance

## Configuration

Refer to [CONFIGURATION.md](docs/CONFIGURATION.md) for detailed information on configuring your Gogs instance.

## Usage

After installation, you can use Gogs to:

- Create and manage Git repositories
- Collaborate with team members
- Track issues and manage projects
- Integrate with CI/CD pipelines

For more information on using Gogs, refer to the [official Gogs documentation](https://gogs.io/docs).

## Advanced Configuration

For advanced configuration options, including custom app.ini settings and environment variables, see [CONFIGURATION.md](docs/CONFIGURATION.md).

## Data Persistence

Data is persisted using Docker volumes. The following volumes are created:

- `gogs_data`: Stores Gogs data and SQLite3 database
- `gogs_config`: Stores Gogs configuration files

## Networking

By default, Gogs is exposed on port 3000. You can change this in the `docker-compose.yml` file or by setting the `GOGS_HTTP_PORT` environment variable.

## Security Considerations

Refer to [SECURITY.md](docs/SECURITY.md) for important security considerations and best practices.

## Performance Tuning

For tips on optimizing Gogs performance, see [PERFORMANCE_TUNING.md](docs/PERFORMANCE_TUNING.md).

## Upgrading

For instructions on upgrading your Gogs instance, see [UPGRADING.md](docs/UPGRADING.md).

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues, refer to [TROUBLESHOOTING.md](docs/TROUBLESHOOTING.md) for common problems and solutions.
